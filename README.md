# A simple Language Translator for txt files (Node.js + Gemini AI)

This project allows users to upload a text file, process its content, and translate it into a specified language (currently set to **Hindi**) using **Google Gemini AI**.  
You can change the language in code directly as -> inside test_pdf.js -> merge function -> inside prompt -> just edit "Hindi" to desired language , dont change anything else.
The translated result is returned as a downloadable `.txt` file.
